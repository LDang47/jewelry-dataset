Clustering model on the jewelry dataset

You work at a local jewelry store. You’ve recently been promoted and the store owner asked you to better understand your customers. Using some sneaky magic (and the help of Environics!), you’ve managed to collect some useful features for a subset of your customers: age, income, spending score, and savings (i.e., how much savings they have in their bank account). Use these features to segment your customers and create customer personas.
TASKS
1.	[Code] Perform a clustering analysis of the dataset. 
a.	Load, clean, and preprocess the data as you find necessary.
b.	Cluster the data using any clustering algorithm discussed in class. Measure goodness-of-fit. Try different values of hyper parameters to see how they affect goodness-of-fit.
c.	Print summary statistics for each cluster.
2.	[Text] What do you think the best hyper parameter values are? Why?
3.	[Text] Describe and interpret the clusters with words. That is, create personas.
4.	[Text] How good are your results? What could you do to make them better?
